It is important to identify the variables that influence and predict the life expectancy of a country's population in order to develop appropriate strategies to improve the quality and performance of the healthcare system and thereby increase life expectancy. Research conducted to estimate life expectancy focuses on modeling life expectancy using multivariate linear regression or multiple linear regression based on observed health and mortality trends in the population, as well as social, economic, and environmental factors in a country.

In addition, I also test the statistical significance of the regression coefficients, which indicates whether or not there is a significant relationship between the independent variable and the dependent variable. Multiple regression analysis can also be used to predict the value of the life expectancy variable based on known values of the independent variables, using the regression equation that has been formed."

    First Section: Statistics of the Overall Linear Model. In a linear regression model of the form $$y = \beta_0 + \beta_1X + \epsilon$$ fitting $$N$$ data points with $$p$$ regressors and one regressand, several key statistics are computed. Residual Sum of Squares (RSS). The items on the first section of the summary are:
    - No. Observations: The number of data points $$N$$
    - Df model: Number of parameters in the model $$p$$
    - Df residuals: Degree of freedom of the residuals, equals to $$N - p -1$$
    - R-squared: $$R^2 = 1 - \frac{TSS}{RSS} = 1 - \frac{\sum_{i} (y_i - \bar{y})^2}{\sum_{i} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2}$$ as the coefficient of determination
    - Adjusted R-squared:$${R}^2 = 1 - \frac{(1 - R^2)(n - 1)}{n - p - 1} = 1 - \frac{TSS/df_t}{RSS/df_e} = 1 - \frac{(1 - R^2)(n - 1)}{n - p - 1}$$
    - F-statistic and Prob (F-statsitic): The null hypothesis that all the coefficients of regressors are zero, hence a high p-value means the model is more significant
    - AIC: Akaike Information Criterion, $$ -2\log(\hat{L}) + 2k $$ with $$k = 2$$. It depends on the log-likelihood $$ L $$ and estimates the relative distance between the unknown true likelihood and the fitted likelihood. The lower the AIC, the closer to the truth.
    - BIC: Bayesian Information Criterion, $$ -2\log(\hat{L}) + 2k $$ with $$k = log(N)$$. Based on a Bayesian set up and meansures the posterior probability of a model being true. The lower the BIC means the closer to the truth

    st.markdown(r'''
    The second section: Coefficients determined by the regression.
    - Coef: Coefficient determined by OLS regression, it is solved analytically with $$ \beta = (X^T X)^{-1} X^T y $$
    - Std Err: Estimate of the standard deviation of the coefficient, $$\hat{\sigma}_{j}^2 = \hat{\sigma}^2 \left[Q_{xx}^{-1}\right]_{jj}$$
    where $\hat{\sigma}^2 = \frac{1}{N} \varepsilon^T \varepsilon$ and $Q_{xx} = X^T X$.
    - t: Coef divided by Std Err, i.e., the t statistic, with the null hypothesis that this particular coefficient is zero. It is used as a measurement of whether theh coefficient is significant. A coefficient is significant if its magnitude is large with small standard error
    - the p-value of the t test, i.e., the probability that the variable has no effect on the dependent variable as the null hypothesis is true
